  Is there a manner to have the withinside the url of chrome use a hyphen? I realize every browser renders it different, mozzila leaves the clean areas in. I simply assume More-than-simply-a-quite-internet site appears higher than extra than only a quite internet site.Also I use a 50 person token to affirm signup paperwork thats exceeded withinside the url. Should I be encoding the token or not?
