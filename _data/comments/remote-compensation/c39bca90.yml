message: This year was the first time I'd done a full job search (and been hired) remotely.  I've worked remotely in the past, but it was always for clients I had previously met (and worked with) in person.  As more and more large companies get comfortable having employees who work remotely (such as with the pandemic), I think this will become even more commonplace.  I'm already starting to see job offers trickle in from the high paying markets, where I would probably be a "discount" to them.  As it turned out, I ended up accepting a contract position for a client across the country (2 time zones away), and I expect this to become the new norm.
